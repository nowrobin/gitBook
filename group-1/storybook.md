# Storybook

## Storybook Why do we use it?&#x20;

As I ask my mentors about frontend  they always have mentioned about the use of storybook, I have heard so much about it but never had chance to apply to the one of my project since I didn't see the point on my small side-projects.&#x20;

I did not see the point of this until my mentor gave me real-life example of usage. company size projects  contains way to many components to control and to combine them it will give us bugs thats we cannot tract. this is here 'Storybook' comes in handy we create components through storybook, and &#x20;

CRA 를 활용할때  Storybook 설정&#x20;

```bash
$ npx create-react-app storybook-app --template typescript
```

Vite를 사용할때 Storybook 설정
