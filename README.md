# Week1

## Silicon Boot camp&#x20;

Silicon-valley bootcamp  is bootcamp the sponsored by our school which we can join for free as we go get accepted. It was free for our school but other than school had to pay to get in. As there were too many volunteers for this program Staff had to reduce the number by half.&#x20;

&#x20;Although there were too many people join and easily went over their expectation. They have made decision on accepting most of the people that attended the interview.  But there is always a catch,&#x20;

"Challenge 1on 1" is what they call it, it where people get eliminated if they do not work hard enough and do not attend sessions or team meetings. And mentors visit team meeting without telling to check if we actually working.  In addition to that we have to attend late night meeting that randomly opens (like 2:30, 3:30 am ) .&#x20;

## Our Group

Our Group is made out of 3 front-end, 4 back-end(feat. AI);

We did little icebreaking time and  from there we introduced ourselves and check how experienced with our skills as with what language, library and frameworks we could use.&#x20;

It was not my first time using React and  JS  but  I was  not experience enough to get jobs done on my own. Thankfully our leader is front-end, which helped me a lot by explaining things I did not know and using different ways of using library just as React Query and Mock API.&#x20;

We spent most of our time searching for the topic for our project and worked on the POC together. We came up with this idea of recognizing sign languages. We all thought this would be the perfect Idea for our team as we go through our POC, There were enough references that we could use and our AI guy already confirmed that worked.&#x20;
